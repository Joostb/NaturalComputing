\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	The probability that all three doctors give the correct answer is $ 0.8^3 = 0.512$. 
	\item 
	The probability that exactly 2 doctors make the right call is $0.8*0.8*0.2 + 0.8*0.2*0.8 + 0.2*0.8*0.8 = 0.384$. Therefore, the probability that \emph{at least} two doctors make the right call is $0.512 + 0.384 = 0.896$.
	\item  The probability that this group makes the right decision based on majority voting is $0.512 + 0.384 = 0.896$ since the majority is when there are at least two individuals. 
	%(Alternative approach, the probability that they all fail, and that exactly two doctors fail is ...)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{}
The general formula is 
\[
	P(\text{correct predictions} > c/2) \sum_{i = \floor{n/2}}^{n} p^{i}  (1-p)^{n-i}  \binom{n}{i}.
\]

Using this formula, we find a probability of about $0.826$.

\subsection{}
If we use $10000$ runs of the simulations, we get an approximately equal result of $0.826$. Writing out more decimals gives us a difference of $0.0057$. So our approximation is pretty good.

\subsection{}
We decided to use a surfplot for the visualization. Here we can easily spot the differences when variables change relative to each other.

The surfplot can be found in figure \ref{fig:surf_probs}. What we can observe from this plot is that the jury size matters for a low number of people, but that this effect has exponentially diminishing returns. The competence, as expected, has the highest effect on the probability of correctly making the right decision.

\subsection{}
The probabilities for making the correct decision for the groups are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{radiologists}: $0.850$
	\item \textbf{doctors}: $0.896$
	\item \textbf{students}: $0.826$
\end{itemize}
To reach the same probability for making the correct decision as the group of doctors, using only students. You would need 28 students. These would, collectively, have a probability of making the correct decision of $0.898$.
